# Progression Made

- videos

## Progression on Video Description
The current files, vid_backend.py & vid_frontend.py, are not the finished product.
# Currently Working on / Errors
- ❌ After uploading an MP4 file, the app takes a singular frame and sends it to the LLM to process. (Change it to send more frames instead)
- ❌ Streamlit is unable to play the processed video. (A white background is shown but audio is perfectly fine)
