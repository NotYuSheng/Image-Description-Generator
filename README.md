- ✅ User can write their prompt
- ✅ Able to generate a description
- ✅ Creates an CSV file to upload the description
- ✅ Separate into frontend and backend files

- Only up to 5 frames of the video will be used for processing

## Notes
The files *vid_backend.py* and *vid_frontend.py* are the finished products. They consist of both image and video description functions.
The original files, *frontend.py* & *backend.py*, only have the image description function.
